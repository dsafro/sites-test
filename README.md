**_BACKUP LUIS README FILE, LOL FOR REMOVING IT NEWB!_**

# README.md file is standard GitHub practice for every project!

Use this file for anything related to your project, like documentation, help, notes, whatever son!

Here is the about page for GitHub readmes
* https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes

Text and layout formatting is using 'markdown' syntaxt (instead of more complicated HTML or XML) simple stuff, really!
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

So you think you pro now or something?  Dean is actually getting much worse than before, haha, work is absolute hell lately!
